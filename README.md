# Python-Dice-roller
a little random number generator with a UI attached written in python.

Just throw a number in the box as your "number of sides" and watch as it generates a sudo random number between 1, and whatever integer you put in the box. great for playing table top games when you dont have any of your favorite plastic polygons
